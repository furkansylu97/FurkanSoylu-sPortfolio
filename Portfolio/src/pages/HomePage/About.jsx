              My name is Furkan Soylu, and I graduated from the Department of
              Mechatronics Engineering at Katip Ã‡elebi University, where the
              language of instruction is English. Although my background is in
              engineering, I have developed a strong passion for web development
              and continuously improve my skills by working on various projects.
              I am also interested in UI and UX design, focusing on creating
              user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces while keeping up
              with the latest technology trends.

              Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling, listening to
              music, camping, and attending theater performances. These
              activities inspire my creativity and help me approach my work with
              a fresh perspective. Overall, I am a dedicated and innovative
              individual committed to learning and growing in the technology
              field.
